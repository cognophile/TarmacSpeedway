## Opening the project
### IntelliJ IDEA
- From the IntelliJ splash screen, _`open`_ the `Part-A` directory. 

- Right-click the module in the project window and click _'Open module settings'_.

- Ensure the Project SDK, language level, and output path are set as expected. You may need to create a new folder named `out` under the `Part-A` directory and select this for the compiler output. 

- Select _'Modules'_ from the left-hand _'Project settings'_ menu and select the 
_'Sources'_ tab on the right. 

- Select the `src` directory and mark as _'Sources'_, `src/test` as _'Tests'_, and `src/main/resources` as _'Resources'_. Click _'OK'_.

- Configure a runner: _'Run'_ > _'Run...'_ or _'Edit configurations...'_ > set the class path to `main.java.Main`.
